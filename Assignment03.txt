## Theory 

**Chapter - 03 - Laying the foundations **


1. What is JSX ?
 - JSX is an HTML-like syntax that you can use with React to (theoretically) 
   make it easier and more intuitive to create React components. 

2. Superpowers of JSX
  -   improves readabilty of code for better developer experience
  -  JSX helps us in keeping our code simpler and elegant when writing large pieces of code.
  - According to the React docs, most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code. 
  - Faster than normal JavaScript as it performs optimizations while translating to regular JavaScript.

3. Role of type attribute in script tag ? what options can I use there ?  
  - The HTML <script> type Attribute is used to specify the MIME type of script and identify the content of the Tag. 
    It has a Default value which is “text/javascript”.
  - Common “media_type” values are: 
    - text/javascript (this is default)    
    - text/ecmascript    
    - application/ecmascript    
    - application/javascript

4. <TitleComponent />  => Here we are rendering TitleComponent  with self closing tag.
   <TitleComponent></TitleComponent>    => Here we are rendering TitleComponent and also we can passed some child component inside it like below :

    ` 
    <TitleComponent>
      <Titles />
     </TitleComponent>  
    `
    {TitleComponent} => Here we are displaying variable value in JSX.
